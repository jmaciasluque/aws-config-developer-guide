# Managing Conformance Packs Across all Accounts in Your Organization<a name="conformance-pack-organization-apis"></a>

Use AWS Config to manage conformance packs across all AWS accounts within an organization\. You can do the following:
+ Centrally deploy, update, and delete conformance packs across member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations\.
+ Deploy a common set of AWS Config rules and remediation actions across all accounts and specify accounts where AWS Config rules and remediation actions should not be created\.
+ Use the APIs from the master account in AWS Organizations to enforce governance by ensuring that the underlying AWS Config rules and remediation actions are not modifiable by your organizationâ€™s member accounts\.

Ensure AWS Config recording is on before you use the following APIs to manage conformance pack rules across all AWS accounts within an organization:
+ [DeleteOrganizationConformancePack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteOrganizationConformancePack.html), deletes the specified organization conformance pack and all of the config rules and remediation actions from all member accounts in that organization\.
+ [DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks.html), returns a list of organization conformance packs\.
+ [DescribeOrganizationConformancePackStatuses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConformancePackStatuses.html), provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organization\.
+ [GetOrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_GetOrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatus.html), returns detailed status for each member account within an organization for a given organization conformance pack\.
+ [PutOrganizationConformancePack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_PutOrganizationConformancePack.html), deploys conformance packs across member accounts in an AWS Organization\.
