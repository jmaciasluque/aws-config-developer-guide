# Managing Conformance Packs Across all Accounts in Your Organization<a name="conformance-pack-organization-apis"></a>

Use AWS Config to manage conformance packs across all AWS accounts within an organization\. You can do the following:
+ Centrally deploy, update, and delete conformance packs across member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations\.
+ Deploy a common set of AWS Config rules and remediation actions across all accounts and specify accounts where AWS Config rules and remediation actions should not be created\.
+ Use the APIs from the master account in AWS Organizations to enforce governance by ensuring that the underlying AWS Config rules and remediation actions are not modifiable by your organizationâ€™s member accounts\.

Ensure AWS Config recording is on before you use the following APIs to manage conformance pack rules across all AWS accounts within an organization:
