# Operational Best Practices for BNM RMiT<a name="operational-best-practices-for-bnm-rmit"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.  

The following provides a sample mapping between the Bank Negara Malaysia \(BNM\) Risk Management in Technology \(RMiT\) and AWS managed Config rules\. Each Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more BNM RMiT controls\. A BNM RMiT control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This Conformance Pack was validated by AWS Security Assurance Services LLC \(AWS SAS\), which is a team of Payment Card Industry Qualified Security Assessors \(QSAs\), HITRUST Certified Common Security Framework Practitioners \(CCSFPs\), and compliance professionals certified to provide guidance and assessments for various industry frameworks\. AWS SAS professionals designed this Conformance Pack to enable you to align to a subset of Title 21 CFR Part 11 design principles\.
