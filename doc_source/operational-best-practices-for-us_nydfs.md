# Operational Best Practices for NYDFS 23<a name="operational-best-practices-for-us_nydfs"></a>

Conformance packs provide a general\-purpose compliance framework designed to enable you to create security, operational or cost\-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions\. Conformance Packs, as sample templates, are not designed to fully ensure compliance with a specific governance or compliance standard\. You are responsible for making your own assessment of whether your use of the Services meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements\.

The following provides a sample mapping between the New York State Department Of Financial Services \(NYDFS\) cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies \(23 NYCRR 500\) and AWS managed Config rules\. Each AWS Config rule applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more US NYDFS controls\. A US NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500 control can be related to multiple Config rules\. Refer to the table below for more detail and guidance related to these mappings\.

This Conformance Pack was validated by AWS Security Assurance Services LLC \(AWS SAS\), which is a team of Payment Card Industry Qualified Security Assessors \(QSAs\), HITRUST Certified Common Security Framework Practitioners \(CCSFPs\), and compliance professionals certified to provide guidance and assessments for various industry frameworks\. AWS SAS professionals designed this Conformance Pack to enable you to align to a subset of the US NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500 design principles\.

**AWS Region:** All supported AWS Regions except Middle East \(Bahrain\)
